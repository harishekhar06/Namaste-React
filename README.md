# Common Practices
- Creating an src folder and inside it adding the components folder
- Separate folders for sepatrate componenets
- Name the componenet folders with same name of component
- Export the componenet from src/componnets first and then import it in the App.js file
- Never keep URLs and other hard coded data (like APIs) in the components folder.
